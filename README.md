# Eurobot-competition

We are a team of 9 students from ECE Paris school of Engineering, building an Open Source platform for competition robots. We attended Eurobot France, Germany and UK.

## Usage and translation

As the license states, you can do anything you want with our files. We are in the process of checking the good translation of all files, so if you do not understand something, please message us.

## Instructions and logs

You can see how we did our project on our Hackaday.io [project](http://past.is/atcrt/). If you need any helpin using our files, feel free to contact us, **preferably on our hackaday project page**. It's one of our first Robotics project and it is far from perfect so we will be glad to hear some advice and criticism from any other teams.

### IRL - In Real Life

This is mostly meant to be a media for other teams to see what we have done in order to understand us and maybe help us at some competitions like the ÃŽle-de-France robotics cup. Feel free to ask questions and contact us IRL!
